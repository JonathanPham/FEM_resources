# Solution of the Schrödinger equation using Ritz method

This folder contain a code for the solution of Schrödinger equation over
the real line using the Ritz method and Hermite functions as basis.

We include the following files:

- hermite_QM.py: that uses the Ritz method to solve the Schrödinger
    equation.
- FDM_QM.py: that uses the Finite Difference Method for the same purpose.

The file [method.pdf](./method.pdf) describes the method used.
