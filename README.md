FEM resources
=============

This is a repo for Finite Element resources. I have used this resources for learning (myself) or prototyping some FEM features before implement them in a bigger FEM software.

Right now it counts with some wxMaxima worksheets, where the CAS Maxima is used to compute analytically the elements.


Installation
============
For wxMaxima worksheets (.wxm files) a wxMaxima (and Maxima) installation is needed. For Windows the Maxima [installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/Maxima-Windows/) already contains wxMaxima. In Linux and Mac OS they should be installed separately: [Maxima](http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/files/), [wxMaxima](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/). Once wxMaxima is installed the worksheets can be downloaded and executed ([10 minutes Maxima](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/tutorials/10minute.zip), [spanish version](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/tutorials/10minute_es.zip)).
